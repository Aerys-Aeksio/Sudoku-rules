-----Sandwich sum:
Clues outside the grid show the sum of the digits sandwiched between the 1 and the 8 in that row or column.
-----Sandwich sum:

-----X-sum:
Clues outside the grid show the sum of the first X digits, where X is the first seen digit.
-----Skyscrapers:
Each digit in the grid represents the height of a building in its cell. Taller buildings obstruct the view of shorter ones behind them. Clues outside the grid give the number of buildings visible from that vantage point in the clue's row or column.
-----Numbered rooms:
Clues outside the grid indicate the digit which has to be placed in the Nth cell in the corresponding direction, where N is the digit placed in the first cell in that direction.
-----Row indexers:
A marked cell in row X indicates the row where X appears in the column.

A marked cell in column X indicates the column where X appears in the row.
-----Shifter dots:
Digts on different sides of a shifter dot must always share either parity (even/odd) OR polarity (high/low) - never neither, never both. Shifter dots can never have 5 on it.
-----Pointer thermos:
Digits along thermometers increase in value from the bulb end. Additionally, thermometer tips point towards a cell containing the digit within the bulb. The value in the tip indicates the distance to this cell. There may be other instances of the digit between the tip and this cell. If a thermometer has more than one tip, then each tip points towards a different instance of the bulb digit.
-----Pointer Arrows:
Digits along arrows sum to the value in the connected circle. Additionally, arrow tips point towards a cell containing the digit within the arrow's circle. The value in the arrow tip indicates the distance from the arrow tip to this cell. There may be other instances of the same digit between this cell and the arrow tip.
-----Friendly Cells:
A cell is friendly if it contains a digit that is the same as it's row, column or box number.
-----Zipper Lines:
Digits an equal distance from the (bumped/circled) center of a Zipper line sum to the same number.
-----Area sum lines:
If a region of cells is enclosed by an unbroken section of orange line, then the sum of digits in the area enclosed by the line is equal to the sum of the digits along the perimeter line section. Digits may repeat on area sum lines if permitted by other rules. Area sum regions cannot be contained within another. i.e. if two area sum regions are conjoined, then the larger conjoined region is not itself an area sum region.
