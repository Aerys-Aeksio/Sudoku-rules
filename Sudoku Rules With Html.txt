  </li>
  <li>
     <strong><u>Skyscrapers:</u></strong><br>
     Each digit in the grid represents the height of a building in its cell. Taller buildings obstruct the view of shorter ones behind them. Clues outside the grid give the number of buildings visible from that vantage point in the clue's row or column.
  </li>
  <li>
     <strong><u>Numbered rooms:</u></strong><br>

     Digts on different sides of a shifter dot must always
share either parity (even/odd) OR polarity (high/low) - never neither, never both. Shifter dots can never have 5 on it.
  </li>
  <li>
     <strong><u>Pointer Thermos:</u></strong><br>
     Digits along thermometers increase in value from the bulb end. Additionally, thermometer tips point towards a cell containing the digit within the bulb. The value in the tip indicates the distance to this cell. There may be other instances of the digit between the tip and this cell. If a thermometer has more than one tip, then each tip points towards a different instance of the bulb digit.
  </li>
  <li>
     <strong><u>Parity lines:</u></strong><br>
     Digts along a parity line alternate between odd and even. For example: 1434 or 23654.
  </li>
</ul>
